# LeeWay 3D Engineering & Blueprint

## Purpose

Translate Creator intent into measurable 2D/3D engineering geometry before selecting Blender, CAD, WebGPU, image generation, or another provider.

## Model contract

Every consequential model should define as applicable: units, origin, coordinate frame/handedness, reference planes, bounding dimensions, constraints, tolerances, materials, part/assembly identity, interfaces, clearances, symmetry, parametric variables, topology/mesh requirements, physical assumptions, target output and acceptance measurements.

## Geometry

Support analytic/parametric primitives, transforms, vectors/matrices, curves/surfaces, Bézier/NURBS concepts where required, constructive solid geometry, assemblies and spatial relationships. Use exact constraints for engineering intent; use artistic approximation only when the deliverable permits it.

## Blueprint views

Generate/validate orthographic front/top/side, section/detail/exploded/isometric views as required. Dimensions must bind to the model/reference geometry and declared units rather than decorative annotations.

## Provider neutrality

Blender is one execution provider. CAD kernels, OpenSCAD-like deterministic geometry, WebGPU/Three.js, SVG/vector tools, or future LeeWay geometry engines may satisfy different deliverables. Capability Resilience selects an authorized provider.

## Blender composition

For Blender execution: 3D Blueprint owns engineering intent/constraints → leeway-blender-mcp owns governed Blender tool sequencing/worker evidence → render/scene inspection verifies visual geometry → Veritas checks dimensions/acceptance evidence.

## Mathematical composition

Use centered metrics/Mathematical Sun only for measured deviations. Geometry acceptance may include dimensional error, angular error, continuity, intersection/clearance, topology validity, polygon/resource budget, render/frame budget and physical/material constraints.

## Parallel lanes

A substantial 3D program may run independent lanes: requirements/dimensions; geometry/parametrics; materials/rendering; hardware/performance; blueprint/documentation; simulation/validation; security/provenance. Serialize mutations to the same canonical scene/model unless merge strategy is explicit.

## Truth

rendered != dimensionally correct; dimensionally correct != manufacturable; manufacturable != physically validated; Blender tool success != blueprint verification.
